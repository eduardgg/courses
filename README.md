# Programming Courses

This repository contains a collection of courses and training materials related to **programming** that I have completed throughout my academic and personal learning journey. The focus is primarily on **algorithms** and **data structures**, with a strong emphasis on **discrete mathematics** and a bit of **numerical methods**.

This repository reflects my passion for **algorithmic thinking** and **mathematical problem-solving**, applied through practical programming in multiple languages, primarily in Python and C++.

## Structure

### 1. **C++: Advanced Topics** (LinkedIn Learning)  
[Link to course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-advanced-topics)  
This LinkedIn Learning course dives into advanced C++ topics, covering classes and inheritance, smart pointers for memory management, move semantics, lambda functions, and unit testing. It also includes building a custom string library and practical applications to help apply these concepts in C++ projects.

### 2. **Algorithms and Data Structures** (UPC)  
Complete course on Algorithms and Data Structures from my BSc in Mathematics at UPC. It covers backtracking, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, computational complexity, advanced data structures, and applications from discrete mathematics, all done in C++.

### 3. **Algorithms Specialization** (Stanford)  
[Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)  
The Algorithms Specialization is a 4-course series led by Stanford professor Tim Roughgarden, offered through Coursera. It provides an introduction to algorithms for learners with some programming experience, focusing on key concepts rather than detailed implementation. Topics include divide and conquer, graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and NP-complete problems, with weekly quizzes and programming assignments. The specialization prepares learners for technical interviews and algorithm discussions.

### 4. **Geometry Basics**  
This folder covers basic topics in geometry processing, such as convex hull, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulation, and efficient algorithms to compute them.

### 5. **Geometry Processing**
[Link to course](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc419h1)  
A course from the University of Toronto on interpreting and manipulating 3D geometric data using algorithms and mathematical techniques. It applies traditional signal processing concepts to 3D curves and surfaces, enabling tasks such as geometric modeling, animation, physical simulation, and computer vision. Key topics include discrete curves and surfaces, curvature computation, surface reconstruction, smoothing and denoising, parameterization, and symmetry detection.

### 6. **Numerical Calculus** (UPC)  
This course covers essential numerical techniques for solving mathematical problems that arise in scientific and engineering contexts. Topics include root-finding methods such as secant, bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Broydenâ€™s method; splines for interpolation; Runge-Kutta methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs); and quadrature techniques for numerical integration. The course also explores the numerical solution of ODEs (Euler's method, diffusion equations) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Practical applications emphasize the implementation of these methods in real-world problems.

### 7. **Introduction to Programming** (UPC)  
This course introduces the basics of C++, focusing on data structures, loops, procedures, recursion, search algorithms, and working with arrays and tuples. Students learn to implement fundamental algorithms and develop problem-solving skills.

### 8. **React Basics**
[Link to course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-para-principiantes-desde-cero-curso-gratuito/)
A beginner-level course introducing React for building interactive user interfaces. Topics include components, state management, and props, with hands-on practice in creating simple web applications.

### 9. **Sedgewick's Introduction to Programming**  
[Link to course](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/)  
This course from Princeton, taught by Robert Sedgewick, teaches core programming concepts using Python, with a strong emphasis on mathematical and abstract thinking. It covers variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and modules, progressing to object-oriented programming and data abstraction. Students also learn fundamental algorithms (sorting, searching) and data structures (stacks, queues), all framed through real-world applications in fields like materials science, genomics, and astrophysics.
